# Next.js Project Bootstrapped with `create-next-app`

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Understanding the Project

In this homework, you have a few challenges to complete. Below are the steps and tasks you need to accomplish:

### 1. Getting the App ID

An App ID is a unique identifier assigned to your application that allows you to configure and manage various settings specific to your user-controlled wallet integration. The App ID is essential for identifying your application and enabling communication with the Circle Platform APIs.

### 2. Creating a New User

In this step, you will create a new user by providing a user ID. You will learn more about this topic in the lesson.

### 3. Acquiring Session Token

You need to obtain a session token for each of your end-users to initiate requests that require a user challenge, such as setting or entering their PIN code. This token will be valid for an hour.

### 4. Initializing User

This is the part where we create a wallet for the specified blockchain. After this step, the user will still need to finish the wallet creation by providing the PIN and the recovery question.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

##Understanding the Project

In this homework, you have a couple of challenges that you need to complete.

#1. Getting the App Id.

An app id is a unique identifier assigned to your application that allows you to configure and manage various settings specific to your user-controlled wallet integration. The app id is essential for identifying your application and enabling communication with the Circle Platform APIs.
#2. Creating a New User

In this step you create a new user by providing a user id. You will learn more in this topic's lesson.
#3. Acquiring Session Token

You need to obtain a session token for each of your end-users to initiate requests that require a user challenge, such as setting or entering their PIN code. This token will be valid for an hour.
#4. Initializing User

This is the part where we create a wallet for the specified blockchain. After this step, user still need to finish the wallet creation by providing the pin and the recovery question.
